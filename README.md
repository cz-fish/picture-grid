# picture-grid

Quick and dirty HTML page that draws a grid over any dropped image to turn it into a reference image for painting. It also shows the image desaturated to highlight values.

[Use it here](https://cz-fish.github.io/picture-grid/). (If the grid doesn't show at first attempt, please try to resize browser window, or reload page).
